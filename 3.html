        <td style="text-align:center;">Carter had sat across from me for two years, when I was still working for the fashion magazine. I rarely saw much of him—a left ear, maybe, a glimpse of his shoulder. Our desks blocked our views of each other.</td>

        <td style="text-align:center;">We published his obituary online. I’d just turned 25. He was 41. There was no mention of how they found him in his apartment in Brooklyn, just a few streets down from where I lived at the time. We drank at the Margaritaville in Times Square that night, the only place near the office where we could drink and talk shit without being overheard. I kept on thinking that if he were around, he’d act too good for Margaritaville, and then come to get black-out drunk anyway.</td>

        <td style="text-align:center;">Carter was a different person to each of us — to me, Carter was a permanent fixture out of the corner of my eye. He was always there, until he wasn’t. It felt like a betrayal when someone else was eventually hired, and moved into his desk.</td>
