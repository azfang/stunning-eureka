<p>This is an ever-evolving collection of personal texts, using the publicized death of an acquaintance as a starting point to explore themes of media, memory, and the nature of information in the digital age. It exists somewhere between a digital archive and a physical object.</p>
<p>These texts will only be online for one day, Wednesday, December 3, 2026. The locks you see before you will eventually be placed in different locations, in different cities, without their respective keys—memorializing a website in lieu of a loved one.</p>
