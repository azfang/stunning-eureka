        <p>In August of 2023, my best friend eloped. She had a secret to tell me, she said, about a year later. E had been the only witness at the ceremony. By then, he and I had stopped speaking.</p>
        <p>I broke our silence to ask him what he remembers from the wedding. No one had dressed up, he replied; they signed their papers at the courthouse, they went out to eat Chinese food afterwards.</p>
        <p>I wondered what I had been doing that day. We had never been good at communicating with each other. I typically found out about events in his life, in our friend’s lives, in roundabout ways. I don't think he would've ever told me if I hadn't asked.</p>
        <p>That same month, he had sent me an email (the subject line: '8/1 stuff’). No message attached, just ten or eleven links to secondhand shopping sites. He was a stylist, and sometimes he would compile shopping links when he came across certain items for me. He was always trying to get me to buy clothes he thought I’d look good in. That was his kind of love.</p>
        <p>The email reminded me of silly little gestures from childhood. Passing notes as schoolchildren, making playlists, burning a CD for someone.</p>
        <p>Two of the items were Comme des Garçons, one was a pair of military-green pants. That’s all I remember, really, besides thinking that I couldn’t picture myself wearing any of it. As hard as I try, I can’t recall anything else.</p>
        <p>I sent back a quick response; I let the pages expire without purchasing anything.</p>
        <p>Perhaps it was too late, when I went back a year later to try to gather details about each garment. There had been other email exchanges, but none which felt like they contained something so similarly irretrievable.</p>
        <p>I tend to believe in the permanence, somehow, of things that exist online, and always feel some sense of loss when I am reminded that the fabric of the web is also riddled with holes.</p>
        <p>In August of 2024, I began looking for other broken links. Arrows taking me in no particular direction, markers of moments that had come and gone.</p>
